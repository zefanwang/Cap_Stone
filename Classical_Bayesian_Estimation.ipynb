    "2. Full rank: no exact linear relationship among X, or multicollinearity, identification problem.  Test VIF.\n",
    "3. Exogeneity of the independent variables: no correlation between X and $\\epsilon$, biased and inconsistent, omitted variable bias.  Use instruments or lag...\n",

    "6. Normal distribution of disturbances\n",

As sample size increase, quality of t statistics approximation improves, asymptotically normal, no need for normally distributed disturbance.  Central Limit Theorem.  Wald test, Z test or $\\chi^2$ might be more efficient than t."
